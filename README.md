hi! I'm Hugo, a middle schooler in New york city! Welcome to my small corner of the github internet, filled with bad code and bad hardware.

I'm a hardware enthusiast! I love to make stuff with Arduinos, Pi's, other SBCs and bare chips! I'm also planning on learning to use FPGAs in the future. 

I design PCBs in my free time!! I post open source designs on here. I use KiCAD, a Free and Open Source (FOSS) EDA for Schematic and PCB design, and a fabulous 3D render. I usually use kicad nightly releases.

I use AVR typically, 328P, 32u4, 1284s, etc, but I'm also beginning to use ATSAM, and the newly released RP2040.

I'm a hack club leader at my school, new explorations into science and technology + math(nest+m), (nestm.hackclub.com)

I'm also learning software development(and also web dev + ML and CV), I know some C and C++, and I plan on learning Python as well. 

I also love stickers, and especially, corgis!

You might have seen my corgi arduinos :)

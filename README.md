I'm entering 7th grade this fall.
I have plenty of experience on Raspberry Pi's and Arduino's.

I do fun stuff with Hack Club.

I like to take stuff apart (but I cannot guarantee them being put together again)

I'm planning on learning C, know some Java, and have virtually no Python experience.

Mainly I work with microcontrollers for prototyping and don't use Raspberry Pi's for that but I use Raspberry Pi's to do whatever I need in computing.

I'm currently learning machine learning with Tensorflow and OpenVINO toolkit, and trying to use a Intel NCS 2.

This repository is for fun stuff!
